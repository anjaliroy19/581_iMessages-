Finalize what language we want to support?

We will be using Swift using XCode. Most IOS apps are written in sprint. Swift is a robust and intuitive programming language created by Apple for building apps for iOS, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. It's designed to give developers more freedom than ever. Swift is easy to use and open source, so anyone with an idea can create something incredible. Swift programming language provides modern coding features like type inference, closures, and generics etc. It also has several powerful tools to enhance app safety and system performance. In our app we will also be supporting C++. C++ is a fast and strongly typed programming language which makes it an ideal choice for developing operating systems. We think that C++ is widely used in the industry and python after we are done with C++. Moreover, companies that use Python programming make the app development process time-efficient, fast, and easy.
