Low load compiler?

We want to make sure the app we create does not take a long time to launch, or respond too slowly to input, which would make our app look slow. To avoid this problem once we have most of the code for the app we will gather data on our app's current performance by using Xcode Organizer to view the metrics of launch time, UI responsiveness, memory use, and energy use. We would also use MetricKit to get more data like average pixel luminance, and cellular network conditions. Once seeing all these metrics we will look at which of these metrics is slowing our app down the most. Then we will profile our app and use different types of templates depending on the specific issue. Hopefully after these steps we will see better performance from the app by comparing the behavior of the new data with the original data using the same metric tests.
