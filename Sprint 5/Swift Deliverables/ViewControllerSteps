Step 1: In storyboard, drag a new UIViewController onto the Canvas. 

Step 2: Each view controller should have a name that describes what kind of information or task it has. 
To create a new view controller, select File->New->File and select a Cocoa Touch Class. Choose whether 
to create it with Swift or Objective-C and inherit from UIViewController. View Controllers are often 
in their own folder or "group" in the project explorer. 

Step 3: Finally, you have to connect the view controller in Storyboard with the Swift view controller 
you just created. Do that by selecting the view controller and setting the Identity Inspector.
