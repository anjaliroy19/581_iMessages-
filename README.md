### General Info

Project: iMessages++

Project Description: 

  >The purpose of iMessages++ is to communicate code easily through messaging. This software will be designed for iPhones and an extension will be required to implement the features. The application will appear on the gray task bar when texting another individual.
  >
  >The icon will be like VS Code or XCode and reside besides the other icons such as game pigeon. Once the button image is clicked, it will display a few options of what language you wish to type in as well as the distinguished color scheme for syntax. A drop-down option will appear like online GDB where the list of languages will be displayed. Once the option is selected the messages will prepopulate a template of code to get started.
